    "## Introduction\n",
    "The level-set method is a method designed for modeling material interaction. The main idea is based on a function $l$, which satisfies the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ l(x) \\begin{cases}\n",
    "         > 0 \\text{ if } x \\in \\Omega_1 \\\\\n",
    "         < 0 \\text{ in } x \\in \\Omega_2\n",
    "    \\end{cases}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus only on the interaction between two incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with different\n",
    "constant parameters $\\rho_i, \\mu_i \\in \\Omega_i$ for $i  \\in  \\{ 1, 2 \\}$. The function $l$ allows us to define\n",
    "viscosity $\\mu$ and density $\\rho$ in the whole domain $\\Omega$ as a single\n",
    "function\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\mu(l) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{sign}(l) + 1)\\mu_1 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{sign}(l) - 1) \\mu_2\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "and\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\rho(l) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{sign}(l) + 1)\\rho_1 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{sign}(l) - 1) \\rho_2.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Because we would like to solve the evolution problem, the $\\Omega_i$ and the function $l$\n",
    "have to depend on time. We want $l$ to be constant along streamlines for the prescribed velocity field $v$.\n",
    "This condition is satisfied if\n",
    "$$ \\partial_t l(x, t) + \\text{div}(l(x, t) v(x,  t)) = 0. $$\n",
    "We can now formulate the whole system, firstly in the strong sense.\n",
    "$$ \\rho(l) \\left( \\partial_t v + (v \\cdot \\nabla) v \\right)  = \\text{div}\\left(\\mathbb{T}(\\mu(l), \\nabla v)\\right) + \\rho(l)g,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{T}(\\mu(l), \\nabla v) = \\mu(l)\\left( \\nabla v + (\\nabla v)^T \\right) - p\\mathbb{I}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\partial_t l + \\text{div}(l v) = 0, $$\n",
